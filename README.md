# HTML5 Background Video Example

In many cases, I could see this as being really annoying, but there are certain scenarios where a subtle background video using the HTML5 <video> element can be very effective.

For more information, see MDN's [entry](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/video) on the HTML5 video element and [Responsive HTML5/CSS3 Video Background](http://benkaminski.com/2013/05/26/responsive-html5-css3-video-background-in-div-no-javascript/) by Ben Kaminski.

The sphere eversion video clip I use in the example can be found [here](http://www.th.physik.uni-bonn.de/th/People/netah/cy/movies/sphere.mpg).
